Introduce
==========

The repository contains the rules for [krep] to import the source codes of
Netgear routers from its [NETGEAR-Open-Source-Code-for-Programmers-GPL] website.

Each router project was imported in different time. Because the rules are
updated accordingly with the late projects, the final importing stuffs will be
changed comparing with the actual files in the corresponding git repositories.
Generally, the last release with the updated rules will keep the precise
contents.

It's not hard to use `krep` with its subcommand `repo-import` to import Netgear
projects based on Broadcom router codes.
